# Aethrakor: The Citadel of Ashes - A Text Adventure Game by Tim Trott

This is my first attempt at games programming, one of the few areas I haven't been involved with in the past.

This game is a recreation of a simple text adventure game similar to the one I wrote back in school on a BBC Micro (mid-1980s) and is similar in style to the old Fighting Fantasy book adventures I grew up with.

The game isn't complex, difficult, will take a few minutes to complete and isn't even release worthy - it's simply a way to learn the concepts. It uses plain HTML and JavaScript with some data in JSON.

The game offers the player a few choices, each one leading to a different chapter, a simple inventory where the player can pick up, use and drop items.

The game is playable online at [TimTrottCodes](https://timtrottcodes.pages.dev/).

To run locally you will need to host on a local server, such as LivePreview or mongoose since the Javascript needs a webserver connection to fetch the JSON file contents.
